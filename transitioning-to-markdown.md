# Making a start

Transitioning to a new system of writing can feel like a very daunting task, especially when you’re coming from a word processor like MS Word or LibreOffice Writer, and you’re going to Markdown, where the whole concept is built around the divorce of content from appearance and *structuring* rather than *layouting* text.

The good news is that you don’t need to do it all at once and that that you can also always still go back to, for example, Word. Markdown exports into DOCX just fine, so anything you write in Markdown will be exportable into Word, where you can then continue working on it in the future. (Not so much the other way around, but Markdown to Word is, so to speak, reversible.)

If you’re in the process of writing academic work and you’re not yet certain if Markdown will be right for you, you don’t need to try and start using it for that specific piece of academic writing. Start with small, everyday things that you might have to write anyway instead, such as a To-Do list. If you want to include Markdown into your daily academic work, you can for example also start taking notes in Markdown rather than using a Word document to store them. In an application like Zettlr, which is specifically built to allow for convenient note-taking, that is actually one of the best ways to start incorporating Markdown into your daily workflow.

Remember, if you want the notes you took as a Word document later, you can always export them from Markdown into Word. You’re not losing anything, or any work, by tying them up in Markdown first, it’s just one way to get more accustomed with the new approach.

# Scaling it up

If you’re planning to use Markdown for academic work, the best time to make the switch is probably before you start with a new piece of writing, and then just use Markdown for that from the very start. That, however, is often not the kind of situation you’ll be finding yourself in; it’s much more likely that you chose to attend this course because you’re already in the middle of producing academic work and your frustration with Word has reached the point where you’re actively looking for something else.
