# Markdown for Academics: Necron 2026 Online Workshop

Welcome to the “Markdown for Academics” workshop! On this page, you’ll find installation and download instructions for the software and files we are going to use during the workshop. Please make sure to read them carefully and follow them, as things might not work otherwise and we will lose time during the workshop on trying to fix problems. A pre-workshop installation help meeting will take place (date and link to be sent via email), so

+ install the software in good time before that;
+ check if you can open/find it on your computer;
+ download the files prior to the workshop;
+ put them in a folder that is **not** on your OneDrive or Google Drive.

If you run into trouble during the installation or download process, make notes of what is happening so you can describe your problem during the pre-workshop installation help meeting. *The more information you have about what goes wrong, the easier it is to help you!*

## Navigating this page

For those of you who are on a GitHub page for the first time, this is basically one online folder containing a number of subfolders. In this case, the main folder is called “2026-necron”. Currently it has two subfolders you should be able to see: “lesson-01-materials” and “lesson-01-homework”. The first folder contains all of the files and instructions required to prepare for the first workshop. Further instructions are below and specifically under [Pre-lesson preparation](https://github.com/Nerithi/2026-necron?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-lesson-preparation).

As the workshop progresses, more subfolders will appear, such as “lesson-02-homework” or “lesson-02-materials”. You can click on each of them to see what they contain and return to the main folder by clicking on its name at the top of the page.

## How to download the files

Downloading files works differently than you might be used to from other websites. It is easiest if you just click on on the green button that says **“\<\> Code” and choose “Download ZIP”**.
If you have a GitHub account, clone the repository to your own computer ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)). On Windows, you can also download and install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://github.com/apps/desktop) for that purpose.

Once you have downloaded the whole repository as a ZIP, you can unpack it in a folder on your computer. **Avoid** unpacking it to OneDrive or Google Drive. Put it on your hard drive or an external medium like a USB or SSD.

## Note on files starting with .

The two files in question are called “.gitattributes” and “.gitignore”. Do as the latter says and ignore them. While they are required to make GIT work properly, unless you start actively using it, they are not important for you.

# Pre-lesson preparation

1. Download the code.
    + If you downloaded the folder as a ZIP, unpack it to a folder on your computer. **Pay attention:** If you download a ZIP, it always downloads the *whole* repository and all subfolders. If you unzip it over folders from previous lessons, it will attempt to overwrite the files you made changes to. Choose “Skip those files” instead OR unzip into a different new folder.
    + If you cloned the repository to your computer using GIT or the GitHub Desktop application, you can pull the changes. Do not try to commit or push the changes you’ve made locally, it won’t work.
2. Open the file named “pre-\[number\]-preparation” in the folder called “lesson-\[number\]-materials” and follow the instructions there. You can also [view the file directly](lesson-01-materials/pre-01-preparation.md).
3. In case of issues, see below.

# Problems and questions

Questions about the repository and the software can be sent to <e.m.magin@khm.uio.no>. Please be clear about what you’re struggling with. I need to know what you were doing, what you tried to fix it and at which point things went wrong. The more details and specifics you can give me, the easier it will be for me to help you.

Example: “I tried to install Zettlr, but my computer refused to and asked for permissions. When I entered my credentials, I was told I need elevated privileges to install it.”

This helps me figure out that you’re probably on a work-issued computer where you don’t have admin rights and are thus not allowed to install software for security reasons. One solution for this is to contact your IT department and ask them to install it/give you admin privileges for a limited time.

The other solution is to get a USB, boot up your private computer, download and install Portable Apps from <https://portableapps.com/> and install Zettlr by [following the instructions](https://portableapps.com/support/platform#installing) on their website. Added benefit: You can now connect that USB to any Windows computer you like and use the portable apps on the USB without needing admin rights.
