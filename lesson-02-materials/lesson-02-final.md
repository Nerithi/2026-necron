# Discussion

As mentioned in the [overview](#overview-material) and as been discussed previously[^discussion], 12^th^ century excavations have yielded the majority of evidence [@potsandpans2024].

[^discussion]: For example by @potsandpans2024 [p. 12] , [@cookingequipment2020, p. 22] or [@liftingthelid2016, p. 101, 204, 330].

@liftingthelid2016 [p. 200] was still of the opinion that this was due to preservation conditions. However, they corrected this statement in @cookingequipment2020.
