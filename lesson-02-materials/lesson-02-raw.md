Discussion

As mentioned in the overview and as been discussed previously (for example by Postdoc 2024, 12, Postdoc and Supervisor 2020, 22 or Supervisor 2016, 101, 204, 330), 12th century excavations have yielded the majority of evidence (Postdoc 2024).

Supervisor (2016, 200) was still of the opinion that this was due to preservation conditions. However, they corrected this statement in Supervisor and Postdoc 2020.
