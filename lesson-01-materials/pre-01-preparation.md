# Software for the first lesson

For the first lesson, you need to install the following software.

## Zettlr

Zettlr is free and open source and you can download it from <https://zettlr.com/download> for your operating system.

Zettlr can usually be installed without admin rights. However, some institutions have very strict security rules and you may not be allowed to install any software without clearance from your IT department.

### Solution 1

Contact IT, ask them to install Zettlr for you or to give you elevated privileges to install it yourself prior to the workshop.

Take into account that it will likely take IT quite some time to get around to your request and that they may refuse it all the same. Your chances of getting it done an hour before the workshop starts are very low, so consider solution 2 instead.

### Solution 2

Get a USB, boot up your private computer, download and install Portable Apps from <https://portableapps.com/> and install Zettlr by [following the instructions](https://portableapps.com/support/platform#installing) on their website.

## Pandoc

Pandoc is a universal, free and open source document translator. Follow the [installation instructions](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for your operating system. If you cannot install from the .msi on Windows, download the ZIP and unpack it into a folder clearly labeled “pandoc” on your C-drive, preferably directly in your user directory: “C:\User\yourusername\pandoc”. Please do **not** install it on OneDrive or Google Drive, rather, unzip it on a USB.

# Alternative software

If you absolutely cannot get Zettlr installed whatsoever, you have the following alternatives:

## Install a common all-purpose editor

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* [KATE](kate-editor.org)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [gedit](https://gedit-text-editor.org/)

Several of these are available from the Microsoft store and/or for Mac. Your university/institution almost certainly also has at least one editor in their Software library, so search for “editor”, “Markdown” or “plaintext editor”.

## Install a different Markdown application

* [Ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/)
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
* [Typora](https://typora.io/) (one-time 14.99$)
* [Deepdwn](https://www.deepdwn.com/) (one-time 14.99$)

# Which file works for me?

On a Windows machine, installation files end with “.exe” or “.msi”. Your system is almost certainly a 64-bit system, or “x86_amd64”.

On a Mac, your installation files end with “.dmg”.

On Linux, check your distribution’s wiki/forum to see which installation file you need. Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.) can usually work with “.deb”.
